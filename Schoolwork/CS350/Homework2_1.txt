-------------------- Problem 3.19 - Page 84 ----------------

a.) Area code on the phone numbers is missing.

b.) Append the area code to the numbers themselves.

c.) The advantages are that if there is a name change, because 
someone got married, only the last name needs to be changed.
However, if it was one attribute, it would need to be completely
reset, even though only the last name is changing.

d.) If the information stored is going to change part of the value
when an update query is called, it should be stored in separate
attributes,other than that, store it in one.

e.) Design 1: Add five attributes for phone numbers, and set the
unused ones to null.

Design 2: Add a foreign key table, that has the Student's Ssn as a reference,
that points to secondary student phone numbers.
