--------------------------- Problem 19.17 - Page 724 ---------------------------


A nondense index can be used in the implementation of an
aggregate operator, because not all aggregate operators
need all the unique values. One example could be the
MIN/MAX Aggregates, which can search through and find
the minimum and max with a nondense index just fine.
