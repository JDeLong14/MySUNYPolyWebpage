--------------------------- Problem 19.16 - Page 724 ---------------------------


**2 SELECT Statements

This would be:

bR because you have to scan through everything.

This would end up being:

SELECT = 2*bR


** JOIN Statement

Since a JOIN is the same concept as UNION in that
it has to go through each relation (R and S) and
then scan through for each of them once more at the
end to remove attributes based on the JOIN that is
happening.

Therefore the cost will be:

JOIN = k*( (bR*log2bR) + (bS*log2bS) )+ bR + bS

** PROJECT Statement

This was already discussed in 19.15.

The cost function is (assuming there is no key relation):

PROJECT = 3*bR + k*bR *log2bR

Therefore, the total cost would be

SELECT + JOIN + PROJECT = (2*bR) + (k*( (bR*log2bR) + (bS*log2bS) )+ bR + bS) +
			3*bR + k*bR *log2bR)
